The Weather Journal App is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to log their daily weather experiences and emotions. Users enter a zip code to retrieve current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, which includes temperature and weather conditions. They can also input their personal feelings about the weather. The app displays this information dynamically on the webpage, providing a snapshot of the user's weather-related journal entries.

This project is designed to demonstrate the integration of web APIs, the use of asynchronous JavaScript for API requests, and the dynamic updating of the user interface. It employs a Node.js server with Express to handle backend operations and data storage. The project also includes basic error handling and a responsive design to ensure usability across various devices.
